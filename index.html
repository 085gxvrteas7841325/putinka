         Featured Method: BEST TikTok Method -->
        <section class="featured-method-card method-card">
            <h2 class="method-title-trigger">‚≠ê BEST TikTok Method ‚≠ê</h2>
            <div class="method-content-collapsible">
                <p>This method involves streaming pre-recorded content on TikTok to gather engagement and increase your beam count. Follow these steps to set it up:</p>
                
                <h4>Step 1: Prepare Your Video</h4>
                <p>You will need a pre-recorded video that you plan to stream. This video will be at the bottom of this thread, so ensure it‚Äôs ready to go!</p>
                
                <h4>Step 2: Add Your Private Server/Profile Link</h4>
                <p>Once your video is ready, go to your TikTok profile. In your TikTok bio, you must add either your private server link or your profile link (whichever you prefer).</p>
                <p>If you have at least 1,000 followers, you can add a clickable website link to your bio. If you don‚Äôt have 1k followers, you can‚Äôt add a clickable link.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also use bio.link or Linktree to share multiple links in your TikTok bio. These services allow you to create a single link that leads to multiple destinations, such as your private server, profile, or any other relevant links.</p>
                
                <h4>Step 3: Start the Live Stream Using an External Device</h4>
                <p>Use a separate device to initiate the stream.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>On your device, press the <strong>+</strong> button to go live.</li>
                    <li>Select "Mobile Gaming" as the category for your stream.</li>
                    <li>Once your stream begins, let it sit all day long ‚Äî you‚Äôre essentially streaming your pre-recorded content as a "live" video.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> The stream will look like a real live video, but it‚Äôs actually pre-recorded.</p>
                
                <h4>What Is a Pre-Recorded Stream on TikTok?</h4>
                <p>A pre-recorded stream is when you play a video as if it‚Äôs live, even though it was recorded earlier. This technique allows you to keep your stream running without having to do anything in real time. It works well for gaining engagement, as viewers think they are watching a live event.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Be prepared for 50-100 beams every day by maintaining this setup and finding more pre-recorded videos to keep the stream going.</p>
                
                <h4>Final Tips:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>This method can help you grow your follower count and engagement without actively streaming in real-time.</li>
                    <li>Keep an eye on your TikTok account to make sure the stream remains live and that your links in the bio are working.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Download Pre-Recorded Files:</h4>
                <p>Links to download various pre-recorded stream files are provided below for you to use in your TikTok lives.</p>

                <h4>Step 2: Start Trading</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Post messages like: <code>trading racoon dm me</code> in each server.</li>
                    <li>When someone DMs you, chat and negotiate a trade that seems very favorable to them.</li>
                    <li>Once they‚Äôre convinced, send them your fake private server link.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The more servers you join and the more active you are, the more targets you'll get!</p>

                    <p>The Youtube Method allows you to auto-upload scam videos and maximize exposure with minimal effort. Works best with multiple accounts!</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a video that tricks viewers into following your steps (e.g., for a fake giveaway or scam).</li>
                        <li>Upload the video to Youtube. Instead of uploading daily, use the <strong>Schedule</strong> option at the end of the upload process.</li>
                        <li>Schedule the same video to post every day for a month (or longer). You can set up 30+ scheduled posts in advance!</li>
                        <li>Let the automation work: your video will appear new every day, drawing in new viewers and potential targets.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The more accounts you use, the greater your reach. Some users have run this for a year and gotten many hits!</p>

                    </ul>
                    <h4>How to do this:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make a Discord server.</li>

                        <li>Post a Roblox condo video on the YouTube channel and link the Discord server in the description (doesn't have to be your condo, can be any).</li>
                        <li>Wait until you have 100 members in the server. Ensure nobody can talk in the server and DO NOT post anything until you have 100 members.</li>

                    <h4>Steps:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make yourself a "Hot" avatar.</li>
                        <li>Go into any game with a decent amount of rich girls/boys and find someone that is rich and has premium. (Or just find anyone you know and you don't really like.)</li>
                        <li>Tell them that they have a really nice outfit and that they seem really nice.</li>
                        <li>Ask if you wanna be friends and say that you don't have any and that you are a bit awkward.</li>
                        <li>They will mostly say yes; if they don't, then just find someone else.</li>
                        <li>Ask for their Discord. They will most likely give it to you.</li>
                        <li>Be nice and kind, always message something to them, make jokes until they like you.</li>
                        <li>If they ask personal stuff, just make stuff up.</li>
                        <li>Now the hardest part: try getting him/her as your Girlfriend or Boyfriend.</li>
                        <li>If you now have a fake Roblox girlfriend, you're almost done.</li>
                        <li>Ask her if she can make you a really nice avatar and send her your password (make sure your trades are off and you have a pin).</li>
                        <li>Now, ask her if you can make an avatar for her. She will say yes 95% of the time.</li>
                        <li>Get her limiteds.</li>
                        <li>Enjoy!</li>
